From the quarterly financial data provided by `yfinance` (i.e., `quarterly_balance_sheet`, `quarterly_cash_flow`, `quarterly_earnings`, `quarterly_financials`, and `quarterly_income_stmt`), you can engineer several key financial ratios and metrics that are valuable for predicting stock price movements. Here’s a breakdown of potential features you can derive from each of these datasets:

### 1. **Quarterly Balance Sheet**
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E)**: Total Liabilities / Shareholder's Equity. This ratio provides insight into the level of a company's debt relative to its equity, indicating financial leverage and risk.
- **Current Ratio**: Current Assets / Current Liabilities. A measure of liquidity, showing how well a company can meet short-term obligations.
- **Quick Ratio (Acid Test)**: (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities. It's a more stringent test of liquidity compared to the current ratio.
- **Book Value Per Share**: Total Equity / Number of Outstanding Shares. Indicates the equity value per share and is used to compare the book value with the market value of the shares.

### 2. **Quarterly Cash Flow**
- **Operating Cash Flow Margin**: Operating Cash Flow / Total Revenue. This ratio measures how much cash a company generates from its operational activities relative to its revenue.
- **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures. Free cash flow is an indicator of a company's ability to generate additional revenues.
- **Cash Flow Coverage Ratios**: Various ratios that use cash flow figures to assess how well a company can meet its financial obligations, such as debt payments.

### 3. **Quarterly Earnings**
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth**: Year-over-Year growth in EPS. This is a direct measure of a company's profitability and growth over time.
- **P/E Ratio**: Market Price Per Share / Earnings Per Share. While market price is not a direct output of `quarterly_earnings`, when combined with current stock prices, this ratio is essential for valuation.

### 4. **Quarterly Financials**
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: Net Income / Total Assets. This indicates how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate earnings.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Net Income / Shareholder's Equity. This measures the profitability of equity investments, indicating how effectively a company uses equity financing.
- **Gross Profit Margin**: Gross Profit / Total Revenue. Shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold.

### 5. **Quarterly Income Statement**
- **Operating Margin**: Operating Income / Total Revenue. It helps to understand how much of revenue is remaining after subtracting the operating expenses.
- **Net Profit Margin**: Net Income / Total Revenue. This ratio shows how much of each dollar earned by the company is translated into profits.
- **Year-over-Year Revenue Growth**: Comparison of revenue from the same quarter in previous years to measure business growth.

### Additional Considerations
When creating features for a machine learning model:
- **Normalization**: Consider normalizing or standardizing your financial ratios to avoid scale issues, especially when different features range over different scales.
- **Lagged Variables**: Use lagged versions of these ratios to capture the financial state in previous quarters, helping to observe trends and cyclicality without introducing look-ahead bias.
- **Differential Features**: Create features that capture changes from one quarter to the next to identify growth trends or reversals in financial health.

Engineering these features properly allows your machine learning model to capture a holistic view of the company’s financial health and trends, providing strong predictors for stock price movements.
