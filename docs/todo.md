I apologize for that oversight. Let me provide you with actual resources that you can refer to for learning more about data scaling:

### Articles and Tutorials:
1. **[Feature Scaling and Normalization in Machine Learning: Understanding the Difference Between Normalization vs. Standardization](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-scaling-and-normalization-in-a-machine-learning-model-using-python-9b4d820285f9)** by Parul Pandey on Towards Data Science:
   - This article explains the differences between normalization and standardization, and when to use each method, with Python code examples.

2. **[Why, How, and When to Scale Your Features](https://medium.com/greyatom/why-how-and-when-to-scale-your-features-4b30ab09db5e)** on Medium:
   - This tutorial explains why feature scaling is necessary, how to implement it, and when it's important for your machine learning models.

3. **[Feature Scaling for Machine Learning: A Simple Guide to When and Why to Use Standardization, Normalization, and Log Transformation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#scaling-features-to-a-range)** on the scikit-learn documentation:
   - The scikit-learn documentation provides a detailed guide on various preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling, with practical examples.

### Books:
1. **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron**
   - This book is highly regarded for practical machine learning in Python and covers data preprocessing, including feature scaling, in a comprehensive and hands-on manner.

2. **"Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists" by Andreas C. Müller and Sarah Guido**
   - This book is another excellent resource that explains the fundamentals of machine learning, including data scaling techniques, with practical examples in Python.

3. **"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop**
   - This is a more advanced text that covers the theoretical aspects of machine learning, including data preprocessing and scaling.

### Online Courses:
1. **[Coursera: Feature Engineering for Machine Learning in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/feature-engineering)**
   - This course includes sections on data preprocessing, including scaling and normalization, and provides practical examples of how to apply these techniques.

2. **[Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-nanodegree--nd229)**
   - This course covers essential machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing and scaling, with a focus on practical implementation using Python.

I hope these resources are helpful and provide the information you need to understand data scaling in machine learning!
