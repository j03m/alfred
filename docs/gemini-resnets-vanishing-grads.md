You've stumbled upon a classic problem in deep learning, and it's great that you're observing these details!  It's *not* always the case that "bigger is better."  Here's a breakdown of what's likely happening, why your intuition is partially correct but misses some key nuances, and what you can do about it:

**1. Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**

This is the most likely culprit, especially with a very deep network (100 layers!).  Here's the issue:

*   **Backpropagation:** During training, the gradients (which tell the network how to adjust its weights) are calculated using the chain rule, multiplying derivatives across layers.
*   **Tanh/Sigmoid:** Your `Tanh` activation function has a derivative that's always less than or equal to 1. The `Sigmoid` function also has derivatives that approach 0 in both directions which contributes to this. When you repeatedly multiply many numbers less than 1 (especially those close to 0), the result gets incredibly small.
*   **Vanishing Gradients:**  As these tiny gradients propagate backward through your 100-layer network, they shrink exponentially.  The layers closer to the input receive almost no meaningful gradient signal, meaning they barely learn.  The network effectively becomes much shallower than it seems.
*   **Exploding Gradients:** Less common with `Tanh` and `Sigmoid`, but possible, is the opposite problem.  If your weights initialize in a way that causes activations to be very large, the derivatives might be larger than 1, and repeated multiplication *increases* the gradients exponentially.  This leads to unstable training and huge, erratic weight updates.  While Xavier initialization helps, it's not a foolproof solution for very deep nets.
* **Batch Normalisation** The issue here is amplified because your structure results in the following pattern: Linear -> Activation -> Linear -> Batch Norm. The batch norm happens *after* the activation. This isn't the "ideal" location, as discussed below.

**2. Why the Smaller Network Works Better (So Far)**

*   **Fewer Layers:**  The 10-layer network suffers *much* less from vanishing gradients.  The gradient signal can still propagate back reasonably well, allowing the network to learn.
*   **Easier Optimization Landscape:**  Smaller networks have a simpler loss landscape.  It's generally easier for gradient descent to find a good minimum.  The larger network has a vastly more complex landscape with potentially many more local minima (where it can get stuck).

**3. Overfitting vs. Underfitting (and the Importance of Validation)**

You're right to be cautious about not having evaluated on a validation set yet.  Here's why it's *crucial*:

*   **Training Accuracy vs. Generalization:**  Your smaller network reaching nearly 100% precision on the *training* data is a strong warning sign of **overfitting**.  It's likely memorized the training data rather than learned generalizable patterns.  It might perform *poorly* on unseen data.
*   **Underfitting:** The larger network, while seemingly "stuck," might actually be *underfitting*.  It hasn't learned enough from the training data.  This is because of the vanishing gradient problem, not because it's too complex.
*   **Validation Set:**  A separate validation set (data the model *doesn't* see during training) is essential for determining which model is actually better.  You should track performance on the validation set throughout training. The model with the *best validation performance* is the one you should choose, even if its training performance is lower.  This is the key to preventing overfitting.

**4. Solutions and Things to Try**

Here's a prioritized list of things you should do to address the problems with your larger model and improve training:

*   **4.1.  Change Activation Order (MOST IMPORTANT FOR YOUR CURRENT MODEL):**  The *single most impactful change* you can make, given your existing architecture, is to reorder your layers:

    ```python
    class Vanilla(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, layers=10, hidden_activation=nn.Tanh(), final_activation=nn.Sigmoid()):
            super(Vanilla, self).__init__()
            self.input_size = input_size
            self.output_size = output_size
            self.layers = nn.ModuleList()
            self.first_layer = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
            self.hidden_activation = hidden_activation
            self.final_activation = final_activation

            for i in range(layers):
                self.layers.append(nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size))
                self.layers.append(nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_size))

            self.last_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
            for layer in self.layers:
                if isinstance(layer, nn.Linear):
                    nn.init.xavier_uniform_(layer.weight)
            nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.last_layer.weight)

            #Crucially, change the pairs here!
            self.layers_pairs = zip(self.layers[::2], self.layers[1::2])


        def forward(self, input):
            x = self.first_layer(input)
            x = self.hidden_activation(x)
            for layer, batch_norm in self.layers_pairs:
                x = layer(x)
                x = batch_norm(x)
                x = self.hidden_activation(x) # Apply activation AFTER batch norm
            final_x = self.last_layer(x)
            predictions = self.final_activation(final_x)
            return predictions
    ```

    *   **Why this works:** Batch normalization is most effective when applied *before* the activation function.  By applying it *after*, you're normalizing the output of the `Tanh`, which is already bounded and might have regions of very small gradients.  By applying batch norm *before* the `Tanh`, you ensure that the input to the `Tanh` has a good distribution (mean 0, variance 1), preventing it from saturating and improving gradient flow.  The `layers_pairs` line is changed to iterate over linear layers and batchnorm layers in the right order, and the activation is moved after the batch norm in the `forward` method.

*   **4.2.  ReLU and its Variants:**

    *   **Replace `Tanh` with `ReLU`:** ReLU (`max(0, x)`) is the most common activation function today, and for good reason.  Its derivative is either 0 or 1, which helps mitigate vanishing gradients.
    *   **Leaky ReLU:**  A slight improvement on ReLU: `max(0.01x, x)`.  The small slope for negative values prevents "dead neurons" (neurons that always output 0 and never learn).
    *   **ELU/SELU:**  Other good options that can perform even better than ReLU in some cases.

    ```python
    # Example with Leaky ReLU
    model = Vanilla(..., hidden_activation=nn.LeakyReLU(0.01), ...)
    ```

*   **4.3.  Residual Connections (ResNets):**  This is a fundamental technique for training very deep networks.  It's *much* more effective than just adding batch norm.

    ```python
    class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, hidden_size):
            super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__()
            self.linear1 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
            self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_size)
            self.linear2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
            self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_size)
            self.relu = nn.ReLU()  # Use ReLU here

        def forward(self, x):
            residual = x  # Save the original input
            out = self.relu(self.bn1(self.linear1(x)))
            out = self.bn2(self.linear2(out))
            out += residual  # Add the residual connection
            out = self.relu(out)
            return out

    class ResNetVanilla(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_blocks=10, final_activation=nn.Sigmoid()):
            super(ResNetVanilla, self).__init__()
            self.first_layer = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
            self.blocks = nn.ModuleList([ResidualBlock(hidden_size) for _ in range(num_blocks)])
            self.last_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
            self.final_activation = final_activation
            self.relu = nn.ReLU() #Initial relu

            #Initialize
            nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.first_layer.weight)
            nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.last_layer.weight)


        def forward(self, x):
            x = self.relu(self.first_layer(x))
            for block in self.blocks:
                x = block(x)
            x = self.last_layer(x)
            return self.final_activation(x)

    ```

    *   **Why this works:** The `residual` connection creates a "shortcut" for the gradient to flow backward, bypassing the potentially vanishing gradients of the layers within the block.  This allows gradients to propagate much more easily to earlier layers. The initialization of the residual blocks isn't included for brevity, but you should initialize the linear layers within them using Xavier or Kaiming initialization.

*   **4.4.  Gradient Clipping:**  If you suspect exploding gradients (less likely, but good practice), clip the gradients to a maximum value.

    ```python
    # During your training loop:
    optimizer.step()  # After calculating gradients, but before updating weights
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0) #Example value
    ```

*   **4.5.  Learning Rate Scheduling:** Start with a smaller learning rate, and gradually decrease it during training.  This can help the model fine-tune its weights once it gets closer to a good solution.  PyTorch has built-in schedulers:

    ```python
    from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR

    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)  # Start with a smaller lr
    scheduler = StepLR(optimizer, step_size=30, gamma=0.1)  # Reduce lr by 0.1 every 30 epochs

    # In your training loop:
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # ... training code ...
        scheduler.step()  # Update the learning rate
    ```
    A more sophisticated approach is the `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler, which reduces the learning rate when a metric (like validation loss) stops improving.

*   **4.6.  Different Optimizer:** While Adam is generally good, trying other optimizers like SGD with momentum (and a well-tuned learning rate schedule) can sometimes be beneficial, especially for very deep networks.

*   **4.7.  Weight Initialization:**  You're already using Xavier initialization, which is good.  For ReLU, *Kaiming initialization* (also called He initialization) is often preferred:

    ```python
    for layer in self.layers:
        if isinstance(layer, nn.Linear):
            nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(layer.weight, nonlinearity='relu')  # Or 'leaky_relu'
    ```

*  **4.8 Validation, Validation, Validation**: Always have a validation data set, and use the results of that during training to assess the model.

**In summary:** Your large model is likely suffering from vanishing gradients.  Switching the order of batch normalization and activation, using ReLU (or Leaky ReLU), and incorporating residual connections (ResNets) are the most crucial steps to fixing this and making your deeper model trainable. Don't forget to validate!


## But my data is negative


You're absolutely right to consider the range of your input data and its interaction with ReLU. My previous answer made an oversight in recommending ReLU without addressing this crucial point.

**Negative Inputs and ReLU:**

*   **ReLU's Problem:** The standard ReLU activation (`max(0, x)`) will output 0 for any negative input.  If a significant portion of your *activations* (the outputs of your layers *before* the activation function is applied) are consistently negative, many neurons will become "dead" – they'll always output 0, their gradients will be 0, and they won't learn. This effectively reduces the capacity of your network.  It's *not* just the initial input, but the inputs to *every* ReLU in your network that matter.

*   **Your Scaled Data:** Even if your input data is scaled, if the scaling doesn't guarantee positivity, ReLU alone can still cause problems.  Scaling typically centers data around 0 and adjusts the variance, but doesn't eliminate negative values.

**Solutions (Re-evaluated):**

Given that your inputs (and potentially hidden activations) can be negative, here's a refined set of recommendations, prioritizing the best options:

1.  **Leaky ReLU / ELU / SELU (Best Options):**

    *   **Leaky ReLU:** As mentioned before, `max(0.01x, x)` allows a small, non-zero gradient when the input is negative. This prevents dead neurons and is generally a very good choice.  It's the simplest and often most effective option.
    *   **ELU (Exponential Linear Unit):**  `x if x > 0 else alpha * (exp(x) - 1)`.  ELU has a smooth curve for negative inputs, which can help with gradient flow and learning. It often performs better than Leaky ReLU, but is slightly more computationally expensive.
    *   **SELU (Scaled Exponential Linear Unit):** A variant of ELU designed to self-normalize activations (similar to batch normalization, but built into the activation).  It has specific requirements for weight initialization (use `nn.init.normal_(layer.weight, mean=0.0, std=1.0 / math.sqrt(layer.in_features))` when using Linear layers with SELU and *no* batch norm) and can be very powerful.  It is a great alternative to batchnorm, but is *not* compatible with it. If you decide to use SELU make sure to remove the batch norm layers and to change the weight initialisation.

    These are generally preferred over Tanh when you have negative inputs and want to avoid the vanishing gradient problem as much as possible.

2.  **Tanh + Batch Normalization (BEFORE Activation) + Careful Monitoring (Still Valid, but less preferred):**

    *   The key is the order: `Linear -> BatchNorm1d -> Tanh`.  Batch normalization *before* the `Tanh` helps keep the activations centered around 0 with a reasonable variance. This mitigates the saturation issue of `Tanh` to some extent, even with negative inputs.
    *   **Careful Monitoring:** You *must* monitor the distribution of activations during training.  If you see that a large percentage of your activations are consistently at the extremes of the `Tanh` range (-1 or 1), this indicates saturation and vanishing gradients are still a problem. Use histograms or other visualization techniques to check this.

3.  **ResNets (Still Crucial):**

    *   Regardless of your activation function choice, *residual connections are essential for training very deep networks*. They provide a "gradient highway" that bypasses the potential vanishing gradients in the other layers. Combine ResNets with Leaky ReLU/ELU/SELU for the best results.

4.  **Avoid Standard ReLU:** Given your negative inputs, standard ReLU is *not* recommended.

**Revised Code Example (using Leaky ReLU and ResNet):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import math

class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_size)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_size)
        self.lrelu = nn.LeakyReLU(0.01)  # Use Leaky ReLU

    def forward(self, x):
        residual = x
        out = self.lrelu(self.bn1(self.linear1(x)))
        out = self.bn2(self.linear2(out))
        out += residual  # Add the residual
        out = self.lrelu(out)  # Activation after the addition
        return out

class ResNetVanilla(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_blocks=10, final_activation=nn.Sigmoid()):
        super(ResNetVanilla, self).__init__()
        self.first_layer = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.blocks = nn.ModuleList([ResidualBlock(hidden_size) for _ in range(num_blocks)])
        self.last_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.final_activation = final_activation
        self.lrelu = nn.LeakyReLU(0.01) # Initial Leaky ReLU

        # Kaiming initialization for Leaky ReLU
        nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(self.first_layer.weight, nonlinearity='leaky_relu')
        nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(self.last_layer.weight, nonlinearity='leaky_relu')
        for block in self.blocks:
            nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(block.linear1.weight, nonlinearity='leaky_relu')
            nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(block.linear2.weight, nonlinearity='leaky_relu')

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.lrelu(self.first_layer(x))
        for block in self.blocks:
            x = block(x)
        x = self.last_layer(x)
        return self.final_activation(x)

# Example Usage (same as before, but now with ResNet and Leaky ReLU)
input_size = 20  # Example input size
hidden_size = 1024
output_size = 1
num_blocks = 100

model = ResNetVanilla(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_blocks=num_blocks)

# ... rest of your training loop ...
```

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Leaky ReLU/ELU/SELU are your best choices for activation functions when dealing with negative inputs.**
*   **ResNets are essential for very deep networks.**
*   **Batch Normalization should be *before* the activation (except when using SELU, in which case don't use BatchNorm).**
*   **Always monitor your activations during training, regardless of your choices.**
*   **Use a validation set.**

This refined approach addresses the negative input issue and provides a more robust architecture for your deep learning model. Remember to choose the activation and initialization that are most appropriate for your network and problem.

## Asking about Resnet

You're exactly right in your observation of the ResNet `forward` pass. Let's break down the explanation and provide the key source.

**Source:**

The foundational paper for ResNets is:

  * **Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition** by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun. (2015)
      * [https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
      * This paper won the ILSVRC 2015 (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) and is *extremely* influential in deep learning.

**Explanation of the Residual Connection:**

The code snippet you provided perfectly illustrates the core idea:

```python
def forward(self, x):
    residual = x  # 1. Save the original input
    out = self.lrelu(self.bn1(self.linear1(x)))  # 2. Apply a transformation (linear, BN, activation)
    out = self.bn2(self.linear2(out))  # 3. Apply another transformation (linear, BN)
    out += residual  # 4. Add the original input (residual) to the transformed output
    out = self.lrelu(out)  # 5. Apply activation to the sum
    return out
```

1.  **`residual = x`:**  This line is crucial.  It stores a copy of the *original* input `x` to the block *before* any transformations are applied. This is the "residual" or "shortcut" connection.

2.  **`out = self.lrelu(self.bn1(self.linear1(x)))` and `out = self.bn2(self.linear2(out))`:**  These lines represent the "normal" path through the network.  The input `x` (or the output from the previous layer) goes through a series of transformations: a linear layer, batch normalization, and then a Leaky ReLU activation. This is repeated.  This is where the vanishing gradient problem would normally occur in a very deep network.

3.  **`out += residual`:**  This is the heart of the ResNet.  The *original* input `x` (stored in `residual`) is *added* to the output of the transformations (`out`).  This is element-wise addition.

4.  **`out = self.lrelu(out)`:** Finally, the activation function (Leaky ReLU in this case) is applied to the sum.

**Why does this work? (The core intuition):**

The brilliance of ResNets lies in *how* they learn. Instead of forcing the layers within the block to learn the *entire* desired mapping from input to output, ResNets make it easier by learning a *residual* mapping.

  * **Without Residual Connection:**  A traditional network block tries to learn a function `H(x)` that directly maps the input `x` to the desired output.

  * **With Residual Connection:**  The ResNet block is effectively trying to learn a function `F(x) = H(x) - x`.  In other words, it's trying to learn the *difference* (the *residual*) between the desired output `H(x)` and the input `x`.  The final output `H(x)` is then obtained by adding the input back: `H(x) = F(x) + x`.

**Key Advantages and Explanations:**

1.  **Easier to Learn the Identity Function:**

      * Imagine the ideal transformation for a layer is simply the identity function (i.e., the output should be the same as the input).  In a standard network, the layers would have to learn weights and biases that perfectly cancel each other out to achieve this. This can be surprisingly difficult.
      * With a residual connection, the network can *easily* learn the identity function.  It simply needs to learn to make `F(x)` (the output of the transformations) equal to *zero*.  The `+ x` part automatically takes care of the identity mapping.  Setting weights to zero is much easier for the network than learning a complex set of weights to achieve identity.

2.  **Gradient Flow (The Most Important Part):**

      * During backpropagation, the gradient flows *directly* through the `+ x` connection.  This is the "shortcut" or "skip connection."
      * Consider the derivative of `H(x) = F(x) + x` with respect to `x`: `dH(x)/dx = dF(x)/dx + 1`.
      * The gradient always has a component of `1`. This *guarantees* that the gradient will *not* vanish, even if `dF(x)/dx` becomes very small. The gradient from later layers can propagate back to earlier layers much more effectively, preventing the vanishing gradient problem. The network can learn even when `F(x)`'s gradients are tiny.

3.  **Learning "Refinements":** The residual connection encourages the layers within the block to learn *refinements* or *details* to the input, rather than trying to learn the entire mapping from scratch.  This often leads to better performance and faster learning.

4.  **Deeper Networks Become Possible:**  Because ResNets alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, they make it possible to train much deeper networks (hundreds or even thousands of layers) that would be untrainable without these connections. This allows for learning more complex representations and achieving higher accuracy.

In essence, the residual connection provides a "gradient superhighway" that allows gradients to flow back easily, enabling the training of very deep networks.  It also makes it easier for the network to learn simpler mappings (like the identity function) when needed. This combination of factors makes ResNets extremely powerful.
