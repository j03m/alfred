# LSTM stock price predictor

Contains:

* Train LSTMS against various markets with various parameters - varying accuracy of predictions. I have yet to backtest this into making $$ tho.
* Train a DQNAgent against the predictions of multiple LSTMS  - Performs REALLY well against the data it was trained against womp womp but swapping from stocks to crypto and the agent doesn't outperform a hold.
