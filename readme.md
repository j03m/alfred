# A collection of machine learning experiments for finance

Contains:

* LSTMS with tensorflow (I haven't really refactored this well yet, might be busted)
* Recurrent PPO Trader with sb3 contrib
* Some custom analysis for mean regression that will be used to inform both models

This is very much a WIP - You can see live and past coding sessions on it here:
