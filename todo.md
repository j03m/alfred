* ~finalize linear series experiment~
  * linear does okay, but it doesn't get close to lstm accuracy, though it trains faster
  * How does it do on 5 day price vs lstm?
* Try projecting 2, 3, 4, 5 bars
* Try Conv1d projections
* series translation to trend
* more complicated models - they are still broken advanced lstm and transformer
* more datapoints
  * you can calculate expected earnings using alphavantage surprise - might be interesting to look at projections of price reflected in expected earnings
