# General:
  * Next step - lets make our data better and retain
    * change points on the moving average look weird. Fix or fix how they render
    * multiple moving averages + cps? 30, 60, 90
    * Derivatives (graphing) appear to be on price, maybe add a moving average derivative column
    * Retrain, and check out obtuna
  * How do we not only compare to bench but compare to the absolute trading policy?
    * We should do a study of the optimal vs bench
  * We need to retest this against inverse?
* Read: https://github.com/optuna/optuna
  * In the hyper parameter tuning tutorial they show how different net_arch for the SAC agent have different
  * results. Optuna is supposed to help

# An Option Strategy

Next steps - now that we'll have a buy/sell indicator and some dates with probability
Lets create a new env that overrides our position functions and instead:
* looks at contracts available 
* selects a contract based on strike and expiration where strike is profitable given a mean regression and expiration is after our estimated mean regression
* implement pricing based on whether or not we reach price before expiration
* verify price decay (write a unit test?)
* Finalize the option strategy. Make a call option vs short?

# A Full Market Strat -  ppo
  * Train the PPO to think in this manner across all timeseries?
  * Given what we know of prob + mean reversion can we make an LSTM more accurate than the base?
  * Given what we know of prob + mean reversion can we validate, check, cross reference the LSTMs

# Full Market Strat

  * Train LSTMs to do price prediction on all stocks but use monthly granularity
  * Review the entire market for predict increases in price and low MSE in the last N month (maybe weeks?)
  * Examine the move upward or downward
  * For downward moves scan the market for the strongest inverse?
  * Take positions

# Dividend Strategy

* Scan market for highest yield dividend portfolio/ETFS?
* Consider risk management
* Consider dividend payout periods vs interest

# Tracking

# Risk Management
