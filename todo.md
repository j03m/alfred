# Option Strategy

Next steps - now that we'll have a buy/sell indicator and some dates with probability
Lets create a new env that overrides our position functions and instead:
* looks at contracts available 
* selects a contract based on strike and expiration where strike is profitable given a mean regression and expiration is after our estimated mean regression
* implement pricing based on whether or not we reach price before expiration
* verify price decay (write a unit test?)
* Finalize the option strategy. Make a call option vs short?

# AI

* Fixed the curriculum training (I think)
* Currently training over 250m steps
* After this we need to test it to see if how we score on the very base curriculum. 

* Could we:
  * Train LSTMs to do price prediction on all stocks but use monthly granularity
  * Review the entire market for predict increases in price and low MSE in the last N month (maybe weeks?)
  * Examine the move upward or downward
  * For downward moves scan the market for the strongest inverse?
  * Take positions
  * Train the PPO to think in this manner across all timeseries?
  * Given what we know of prob + mean reversion can we make an LSTM more accurate than the base?
  * Given what we know of prob + mean reversion can we validate, check, cross reference the LSTMs
